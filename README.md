# InstaURLs

Playing around with Instagram, I found a lot of individuals sharing "must-have" URLs. Every now and then I'd come across an interesting one, but if I forget to Screenshot/Bookmark it, finding it again can be a hassle. I decided to spend some "break" time collecting these URLs. If you have any cool sites, go ahead and send a pull request!
