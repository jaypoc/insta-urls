# InstaURLs

Playing around with Instagram, I found a lot of individuals sharing "must-have" URLs. Every now and then I'd come across an interesting one, but if I forget to Screenshot/Bookmark it, finding it again can be a hassle. I decided to spend some "break" time collecting these URLs. Perhaps I'll start to organize them one day.

For now. There's this list:

## The Sites:

* [CSS Layouts](csslayout.io) - CSS code for over 100 CSS layouts and components
* [123Apps](123apps.com) - Online Audio/Video/PDF editing tools
* [Resoomer](https://resoomer.com/en/) - Paste in large text, recieve summarized version
